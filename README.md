## Abstract
This thesis, "Privacy Preserving Biometric Authentication," presents a novel approach to enhancing the security and privacy of biometric authentication systems. It focuses on integrating biometric authentication with cryptographic methods, particularly improving the Game-Set-MATCH protocol from [Game-Set-MATCH](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1363). The study explores the challenges and solutions in merging these technologies, emphasizing the compatibility with deep learning algorithms for more effective and secure biometric authentication. Significant contributions include the development of an enhanced cryptographic protocol and the optimization of the Paillier encryption under private-key algorithms. This work is pivotal in advancing the field of secure and privacy-preserving biometric systems, offering a blend of theoretical insights and practical implications.
